        test_policy__: A Keras-rl policy.
        enable_double_dqn__: A boolean which enable target network as a second network proposed by van Hasselt et al. to decrease overfitting.
        enable_dueling_dqn__: A boolean which enable dueling architecture proposed by Mnih et al.
        dueling_type__: If `enable_dueling_dqn` is set to `True`, a type of dueling architecture must be chosen which calculate Q(s,a) from V(s) and A(s,a) differently. Note that `avg` is recommanded in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581).

        # Arguments
            env: (`Env` instance): Environment that the agent interacts with. See [Env](#env) for details.
            nb_steps (integer): Number of training steps to be performed.
            action_repetition (integer): Number of times the agent repeats the same action without
                observing the environment again. Setting this to a value > 1 can be useful
                if a single action only has a very small effect on the environment.
            callbacks (list of `keras.callbacks.Callback` or `rl.callbacks.Callback` instances):
                List of callbacks to apply during training. See [callbacks](/callbacks) for details.
            verbose (integer): 0 for no logging, 1 for interval logging (compare `log_interval`), 2 for episode logging
            visualize (boolean): If `True`, the environment is visualized during training. However,
                this is likely going to slow down training significantly and is thus intended to be
                a debugging instrument.
            nb_max_start_steps (integer): Number of maximum steps that the agent performs at the beginning
                of each episode using `start_step_policy`. Notice that this is an upper limit since
                the exact number of steps to be performed is sampled uniformly from [0, max_start_steps]
                at the beginning of each episode.
            start_step_policy (`lambda observation: action`): The policy
                to follow if `nb_max_start_steps` > 0. If set to `None`, a random action is performed.
            log_interval (integer): If `verbose` = 1, the number of steps that are considered to be an interval.
            nb_max_episode_steps (integer): Number of steps per episode that the agent performs before
                automatically resetting the environment. Set to `None` if each episode should run
                (potentially indefinitely) until the environment signals a terminal state.
