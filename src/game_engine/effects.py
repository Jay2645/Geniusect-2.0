    It contains metadata regarding the entity, including its ID,
    name, descriptions, etc.

    Showdown will populate JSON files with these elements, which this
    class can load. Subclasses have more data in their JSON file, so
    subclasses of Entity should override the `from_json` function to
    populate those extra data fields.
